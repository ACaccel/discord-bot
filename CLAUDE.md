# Project: BotFleet (TypeScript, discord.js, MongoDB)

Multi-personality Discord bot framework with a layered plugin
architecture, a typed manual IoC container, Repository-pattern
persistence, an LLM-provider Strategy layer, structured errors plus
`Result` types, full i18n routing, and a CJK-literal scanner enforced
in strict mode.

## Key documents

- [`docs/architecture.md`](docs/architecture.md) — layers, key abstractions,
  request flow, plugin lifecycle, design trade-offs
- [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](CONTRIBUTING.md) — contribution index: quality-gate
  reference, architectural rules, security reporting; links the
  step-by-step guides under [`docs/contributing/`](docs/contributing/)
  (local setup, command / plugin / model recipes, operations, branching)
- [`README.md`](README.md) — feature tour and the `.env` / `config.json`
  field reference
- [`CHANGELOG.md`](CHANGELOG.md) — Keep a Changelog; one entry per notable
  change, each linking its commit, written when a release is cut

## Architectural rules

Four load-bearing rules; a CI gate or a reviewer will catch violations.
The full text of each is in `CONTRIBUTING.md`; the recipes under
`docs/contributing/` walk them through.

1. **No CJK literals in `src/handlers/` or `src/plugins/`.** Use translator keys; add `// i18n-ignore: <reason>` only when the literal is not user-facing.
2. **No `process.env.X` outside `src/core/config/env.ts`.**
3. **No new handler / plugin without a test.**
4. **No code change without its documentation.** A change to user-visible behaviour, a config field, a public contract, or a command must update every documentation surface it touches — `docs/architecture.md`, `README.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md` and the guides under `docs/contributing/`, and the matching `config.example.json` — in the same commit. A missing doc update is a defect, like a missing test. `CHANGELOG.md` is the exception: it is not touched by routine commits and is written in one pass when a release is cut, one entry per notable commit since the last tag (see [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](CONTRIBUTING.md)).

## Quality gates (non-negotiable)

This set mirrors the GitHub CI jobs (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) and is a
**hard commit gate: every check must pass locally before you commit** — never
commit on a red or unrun gate.

```bash
yarn typecheck
yarn typecheck:emit
yarn lint
yarn format:check
yarn handlers:gen:check
yarn test
yarn test:coverage
yarn knip
yarn security
```

Two CI checks cannot run locally — **`gitleaks`** (secret scan) and CodeQL —
and run only on GitHub. A `dev` commit triggers the full CI on push, so after
committing you MUST confirm that CI run is green (`gh run list --branch dev`)
and fix any red immediately — CI is a gate, not a passive signal.

No `--no-verify`, no skipped tests, no loosened assertions. If a gate fails,
root-cause it; do not bypass.

## Commit protocol

- **Commit only when the user explicitly asks — then commit AND push together.** Do not auto-commit (or `git commit --amend`) after making changes, completing a task, or fixing review-gate / stop-hook findings — make the edits, run the gates, report, and wait for an explicit "commit" instruction. When the user does ask, push to `dev` in the same step; `git push` is part of the commit action, not a separate authorisation. A one-off "commit this" authorises that commit and its push only.
- Commits are small and focused: `<type>(<scope>): <subject>` where `<type>` is `feat`, `fix`, `refactor`, `chore`, `docs`, or `test`. The body explains the why.
- Routine work is committed **directly to `dev`** — no per-change branch or PR. PRs are required only for `dev` → `main` releases and hotfixes, and are optional for large / risky `feature/*` work. The full branching model is in `docs/contributing/branching-and-releases.md`.
