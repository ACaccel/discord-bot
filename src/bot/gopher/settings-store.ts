/**
 * GopherSettingsStore — the single owner of gopher's runtime-mutable
 * settings and their persistence to `config.json`.
 *
 * Today the only mutable field is the self-hosted LLM `endpoint`. The store
 * holds the live value in memory (the auto-reply client reads it via
 * `getEndpoint` on every call) and `setEndpoint` both swaps that value and
 * rewrites `config.json` so the change survives a restart, preserving every
 * other key with a 2-space indent.
 *
 * Layering: this lives in the composition-root layer (`src/bot/**`), the
 * only place permitted to touch the filesystem and know `config.json`'s
 * path. The settings-api plugin receives narrow `getEndpoint` / `setEndpoint`
 * callbacks and stays oblivious to the file, so the plugin contract is not
 * widened into a config-file registrar.
 *
 * Validation note: input validation lives at the HTTP boundary (the
 * settings-api plugin's zod schema), so `setEndpoint` trusts it receives a
 * well-formed URL and focuses solely on persistence (single responsibility).
