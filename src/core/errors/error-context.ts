/**
 * Shape of the structured context carried on every {@link DomainError}.
 *
 * `operation` is **required** so every error answers "what was being
 * done when this failed" without callers needing to grep stacks.
 * Additional fields are open-ended (IDs, sanitised input, retry count)
 * but must never carry secrets — the logger redacts known field names
 * (see `src/core/config/redact.ts`) but cannot detect ad-hoc keys
 * containing tokens.
 *
 * Convention for `operation`: `"<Class>.<method>"` for class-scoped
 * failures, `"<module>.<function>"` for free functions
 * (e.g. `"MongoMessageRepo.insertManyIgnoringDuplicates"`,
 * `"MongoConnectionManager.open"`).
