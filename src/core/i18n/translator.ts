 * default i18next-backed implementation lives in `i18next-translator.ts`;
 * application and interface code receives a `Translator` and never
 * embeds literal user-facing text (lint rules enforce this).
 *
 * Adding a new locale requires only:
 *   1. add a value to the `Locale` union below
 *   2. drop a parallel JSON folder under src/i18n/locales/<locale>/
 *   3. the catalog-completeness test will fail until keys match
 *
 * Application/interface code receives a `Translator` via constructor
 * injection so tests can substitute a deterministic fake.
 *
 * Placeholder syntax invariant: catalogs use i18next's `{{name}}` form,
 * NOT single-brace ICU. The two formats are incompatible; do not switch
 * without migrating every catalog entry in lockstep.
