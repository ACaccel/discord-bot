/**
 * Manual IoC container for BotFleet.
 *
 * Why hand-rolled and not Inversify / tsyringe / NestJS:
 *   - No reflect-metadata, no decorators, no class-emit gymnastics.
 *   - The implementation fits in this file and is debuggable in isolation.
 *   - At this project's scale a DI framework adds more surface than it
 *     removes; this module is the deliberate alternative.
 *
 * Public surface:
 *   - {@link ServiceToken} + {@link token}: typed handles with symbol
 *     identity (collision-proof) and an invariant phantom field so
 *     `ServiceToken<Dog>` is not assignable to `ServiceToken<Animal>`.
 *   - {@link Resolver}: read-only side, the only thing factories receive.
 *   - {@link ServiceContainer}: read + register, owned by composition roots.
 *
 * Singleton is the only lifetime. Every service the bot binds is
 * process-scoped, and per-guild state is reached through explicit
 * factory tokens (`ReposFactory`) rather than a container scope — one
 * line in the composition root instead of a scope object threaded
 * through the whole call graph.
 *
 * Service-locator guard:
 *   Only composition roots (`src/bot/**`) and tests are allowed to
 *   import this module. ESLint's `no-restricted-imports` enforces this so
 *   `handlers/`, `plugins/`, `persistence/`, `infra/` may not call
 *   `container.resolve()` directly — they receive dependencies via
 *   constructor parameters or the plugin host's typed resolver.

/**
 * Opaque, type-safe handle for a single service binding.
 *
 * The phantom is in a function position so `T` is invariant — without
 * this, `ServiceToken<SubT>` would be structurally assignable to
 * `ServiceToken<SuperT>` and a Dog factory could be resolved through an
 * Animal token. The phantom is `?` so it never has to be set at runtime.
