/**
 * In-process file-routing sink for pino.
 *
 * Each JSON Lines record written here is dispatched to a file chosen
 * from its `bot` / `guildId` bindings, rotating on the local-time day
 * boundary. The sink runs in the same Node process as the bot (as a
 * `Writable` consumed by {@link import('pino').multistream}) — no
 * worker thread, no `require.resolve` dance for TypeScript source vs.
 * compiled output, and a clean `close` that flushes every cached file
 * descriptor synchronously enough for graceful shutdown.
 *
 * The in-process multistream design is final, not a stopgap. The
 * routing rules are pure record-content branching plus a write-stream
 * cache, the sink shares the bot's event loop (so `installProcessHandlers`
 * can close every cached fd on the same tick during shutdown), and
 * `pino-abstract-transport` would require a JS worker entry point that
 * is awkward under `ts-node`. Do not switch to a worker-thread transport.
 *
 * Routing rules:
 *   - records carrying `guildId` →
 *     `<rootDir>/<bot>/<guildId>/<YYYY-MM-DD>.log`
 *   - records without `guildId` (system / bot-level lines) →
 *     `<rootDir>/<bot>/<YYYY-MM-DD>.log`
 *
 * Every record MUST carry a `bot` binding — the composition root
 * attaches `{ bot: clientId }` at logger construction so this is an
 * invariant, not a hope. A record without `bot` is a contract bug and
 * the sink throws synchronously inside the write path; there is
 * deliberately no `_unbound` fallback file because silently shuttling
 * mis-bound lines into a junk directory hides the underlying mistake.
 *
 * `bot` is path-encoded only, not field-encoded: the routing step
 * extracts `bot` to choose the file path, then strips it from the
 * record before serialising. Every line under `logs/<bot>/...` already
 * names the owning bot via its parent directory, so re-stating it
 * inside each JSON object is dead weight that bloats both disk usage
 * and `jq` output. `guildId` is left in the record on purpose —
 * downstream aggregators (cross-guild dashboards, archival pipelines)
 * use it as a join key without access to the originating file path.
 *
 * Layer purity: only Node built-ins (`fs`, `path`, `stream`). No
 * discord.js / mongoose / our own infra — `core/**` stays clean. The
 * `time` field on each record is left as pino's UTC ISO so the file
 * is unambiguous to read across timezones; only *file selection* uses
 * local time so rotation happens at the operator's midnight.
