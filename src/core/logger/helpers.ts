/**
 * Handler-facing structured-log helpers — the canonical facade over the
 * typed {@link Logger} for handler / plugin / event callsites.
 *
 * Invariant: the {@link Logger} passed in MUST already carry `bot` in
 * its base bindings. `createBootstrapLogger` (the only production
 * Logger factory) attaches `{ bot: <clientId> }` via pino's `base`, so
 * every child inherits it. These helpers therefore do not re-bind
 * `bot` themselves — the prior `child({ bot: clientId, ... })` shape
 * produced JSON records with two `bot` fields per line, and pino's
 * pretty printer / `jq` consumers had to ignore the duplicate. The
 * `clientId` parameter is gone (no compatibility shim) so callsites
 * shrink and there is no longer a way to drift the duplicate binding
 * back in.
 *
 * Layer purity: this module deliberately depends only on the
 * {@link Logger} interface. Helpers that touch discord.js / axios / fs
 * (Discord-channel mirror, attachment archival) live under
 * `src/infra/discord/` so `core/**` stays free of third-party SDK
 * imports per the architecture contract.

 * `logger === undefined` is a defensive no-op for the pre-`run()` window;
 * any handler-context callsite is guaranteed to receive a defined logger.

 * the exact field; the headline is the upper-cased `eventType` so
 * pretty consoles read like `MESSAGE_UPDATE`. Newlines inside any
 * string field are preserved verbatim — JSON.stringify escapes them
 * in the file sink, and pretty rendering shows them on one line per
 * field via the multi-line formatter. `bot` is ambient via the
 * logger's base bindings; only `guildId` / `guildName` are bound here.
