/**
 * Centralised operator-facing log message templates.
 *
 * Inline log literals scattered across callsites are hard to grep,
 * cannot carry stable event codes, and quietly drift when the same
 * idea is logged from multiple places. Routing operator-facing lines
 * through this module avoids all three.
 *
 * The constants below live in one file so:
 *   - `grep -rn ops:<event-id>` finds every callsite at once.
 *   - A future migration to structured logging (event codes + JSON
 *     payloads) is mechanical — replace one constant, ripple through
 *     every caller without touching their bodies.
 *   - Reviewers can spot inline log literals as code smell: anything
 *     not routed through this module is implicitly ad-hoc.
 *
 * Discipline: new operator-facing log lines that survive PR review
 * SHOULD land here first. Throwaway debug log lines inside a single
 * function body MAY stay inline. Per-handler error bodies forwarded
 * verbatim from caught exceptions (`logger.errorLogger(..., err)`)
 * do not pass through here — that path takes the `Error` value, not
 * a message string.
 *
 * Format conventions:
 *   - Each event is a `() => string` (or arrow with params) returning
 *     the rendered line. The function form lets the caller pass
 *     contextual values without exposing the underlying template
 *     string to inline mutation.
 *   - Lines start with an `ops:<area>.<event>` prefix so log filtering
 *     by area is a single grep.
