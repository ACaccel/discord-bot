/**
 * Plugin contract — types only.
 *
 * This file declares the interfaces every plugin and the
 * {@link PluginHost} agree on. No runtime logic here — see `host.ts`,
 * `event-dispatcher.ts`, `interaction-router.ts`.
 *
 * Design pillars (the host enforces every one):
 *   - **id + version** identify the plugin. Ids are unique per host;
 *     a duplicate fails at register time (cheap, clearest diagnostic,
 *     lifecycle has not yet started).
 *   - **Lifecycle hooks** are all optional `async () => void` and run
 *     in registration order: `init` -> `start` -> `onReady` ->
 *     ... runtime ... -> `onShutdown` (reverse registration order).
 *   - **events** are a typed subscription map over `discord.js`'s
 *     `ClientEvents`. The {@link EventDispatcher} fans events out with
 *     per-subscription `Promise.allSettled` isolation.
 *   - **Failure isolation**: a hook that throws marks the plugin
 *     {@link DisabledPlugin} and the rest of the bot keeps running.
 *
 * Configuration is *not* part of this contract. Each plugin factory
 * parses its own raw config (`parse<X>Config`) at composition time and
 * captures the result in the returned object's closure, so a malformed
 * block fails the boot rather than the first event.
 *
 * Handler registration is *not* part of this contract either. The
 * codegen registries under `src/handlers/<type>/registry.generated.ts`
 * are the single registration mechanism.
 *
 * Service-locator guard: plugins do **not** receive the raw IoC
 * container. {@link PluginInitContext.resolve} is a typed-token
 * accessor; combined with eslint's `no-restricted-imports` blocking
 * `core/ioc` from layered code, plugins cannot bypass DI.

/**
 * Narrow write surface handed to a plugin's `init` hook. Allows the
 * plugin to publish a pre-built instance under a typed token so the
 * rest of the bot can resolve it through normal DI instead of a
 * module-scope holder, keeping all wiring on the typed DI path.
 *
 * Legal **only inside `init`**. The host's lifecycle runner captures
 * the current phase in a closure when it builds the init context, so a
 * plugin that stashes the context object and calls `registerInstance`
 * later (from `start`, `onReady`, `onShutdown`, an event hook, a
 * scheduled job, or an interaction handler) still trips the guard and
 * receives a {@link ConfigurationError} with code
 * `'LIFECYCLE_PHASE_VIOLATION'`. Type-level: the other lifecycle
 * contexts deliberately omit this method, so the obvious misuses do
 * not even compile.
 *
 * Idempotency: re-registering the same token in the same init pass
 * (or across two plugins) surfaces the container's existing
 * `DuplicateRegistrationError`. The host does not catch and rephrase
 * it — a token collision is a composition bug, not a runtime error.
 *
 * Width: only register a *built* instance. Factories and lazy
 * singletons are deliberately not exposed; opening that surface would
 * turn `PluginContext` into a service-locator registrar, which the
 * plugin contract docstring (`types.ts` header) explicitly forbids.
