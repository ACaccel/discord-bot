/**
 * Bounded exponential-backoff retry for transient outbound failures.

 * Lives in `core/` for the same reason `core/scheduling` does: it is
 * pure infrastructure with no Discord, Mongo, or SDK coupling (only
 * `setTimeout` and `Math.random`), and two independent background loops
 * share it — the message-backup channel walker (Discord REST) and the
 * x-media-feed poller (a third-party HTTP API). Both need the same
 * policy: absorb a transient blip, surface a real failure immediately.
 *
 * Relationship to `isTransientNetworkError` (`core/errors`): that
 * predicate answers a narrower question — "is this thrown value one of
 * the socket-level resets the process-level `uncaughtException` net may
 * tolerate?" It inspects `Error` instances only and knows nothing about
 * HTTP status codes or undici's `UND_ERR_*` family.
 * {@link isRetryableError} is deliberately broader, because a bounded
 * retry is cheap whereas swallowing an uncaught exception is not. The
 * two stay separate so widening the retry policy can never widen what
 * the crash handler tolerates. The OS socket codes below overlap with
 * that predicate's whitelist on purpose: the overlap is a consequence of
 * both lists describing real transient failures, not a shared source,
 * and each list is maintained on its own.
