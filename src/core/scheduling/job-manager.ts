/**
 * Keyed wrapper around `node-schedule` that owns the lifecycle of a set
 * of scheduled jobs.
 *
 * Lives in `core/` because it is pure infrastructure: it depends only on
 * `node-schedule` and has no Discord / Mongo coupling. Both the giveaway
 * and activity plugins schedule deferred work, so the wrapper is shared
 * here rather than living inside a single plugin's `internal/`.
 *
 * The job `Map` is supplied by the caller so the plugin can keep its own
 * persistent job registry; `JobManager` is a thin stateless view over it.
 *
 * Failure policy: `node-schedule` discards whatever its callback
 * returns, so a rejected async job would surface only as a process-wide
 * `unhandledRejection` — detached from the job that caused it. Both
 * scheduling methods therefore wrap the callback and route a rejection
 * (or a synchronous throw) to the injected {@link Logger}, tagged with
 * the job key.
