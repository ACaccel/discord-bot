/**
 * Injectable wall-clock abstraction.
 *
 * Pulled out so domain / use-case code can hold an injected `Clock`
 * instead of calling `Date.now()` / `new Date()` directly — tests
 * substitute a deterministic fake, production uses {@link systemClock}.
 *
 * The plugin lifecycle context (`PluginInitContext.clock`) carries a
 * Clock through to every plugin so scheduled jobs / TTL checks stay
 * testable.
 *
 * Convention: business code receives `Clock` via constructor; modules
 * that legitimately need wall-clock time at module load (rare, mostly
 * `core/logger` for timestamps) keep calling `Date` directly.
