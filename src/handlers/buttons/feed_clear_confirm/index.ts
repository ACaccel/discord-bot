/**
 * Confirms clearing every feed subscription in one channel — the
 * destructive half of the prompt `/feed_unsubscribe` shows when a
 * member names neither a platform nor an account.
 *
 * The button is where the deletion actually happens, so it re-derives
 * everything the command established rather than trusting the customId:
 * the guild's repositories, and the invoker's `ViewChannel` on the
 * target. A customId is a public value, and the gap between prompt and
 * click is long enough for a permission to be revoked in.
 *
 * The invoker check is defence in depth. The prompt is ephemeral, so
 * nobody else can see the button, let alone press it; the check costs
 * one comparison and removes the need to reason about that guarantee.
