 * the default instead of being asserted into the type.
 *
 * An over-long keyword is truncated rather than rejected. No zod schema
 * sits on this path, so the only other enforcement is the schema's
 * `maxlength` — which would surface as a database validation error
 * after the account had already been fetched upstream. 100 characters
 * is far beyond what a substring match needs.
 *
 * A blank or whitespace-only keyword counts as "not given", so clearing
 * the option and omitting it mean the same thing. The key is omitted
 * entirely rather than set to `undefined`, because the repository
 * replaces the stored filter wholesale.
