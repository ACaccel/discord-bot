 * Renders what `/feed_subscribe` did with each account it was given.
 *
 * One invocation can name up to `MAX_FEED_ACCOUNTS` accounts and a
 * failure line carries a whole sentence, so the report can outgrow a
 * single Discord message — hence pages rather than a string. Every
 * account appears, including the ones that failed or were never
 * attempted: the member has to be able to tell which handles are now
 * subscribed and which need retyping.
 *
 * This is also where a failure becomes words. The batch loop keeps the
 * error itself, so the operator log can have the untranslated code and
 * the member a sentence in their own language; both renderings live
 * here, side by side, rather than one of them being frozen at the point
 * the error was caught.
