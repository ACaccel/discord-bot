/**
 * Runs `/feed_subscribe`'s per-account work for a whole invocation and
 * reports what happened to each one.
 *
 * Failure isolation is the reason this exists as its own loop. A handle
 * that is misspelled, suspended, or momentarily unreachable must cost
 * that account only — aborting would drop the accounts behind it after
 * the ones ahead had already been written, leaving the member unable to
 * tell which. Every account therefore ends in an outcome record, the
 * unexpected ones included: a throw anywhere in one account's sequence
 * is caught here rather than at the handler boundary. Because that
 * hides the failure from `replyForError`, every caught value goes to
 * `logFailure` — isolation must not cost the operator channel. The two
 * conditions that stop the loop instead of isolating live in
 * `batch-policy.ts`, and an account never reached is reported as
 * `skipped` rather than passed over in silence.
 *
 * Sequential on purpose: a new subscription reads the platform once,
 * and firing twenty of those at once would turn one command into a
 * burst against an upstream the poller has to keep using. It holds no
 * Discord types, so the whole matrix of outcomes is exercised without
 * an interaction; rendering them is `format-outcomes.ts`'s job.
