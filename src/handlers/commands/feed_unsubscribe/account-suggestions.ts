/**
 * Turns a channel's stored subscriptions into the suggestions
 * `/feed_unsubscribe` offers for its `account` option.
 *
 * The option takes a list, so completion works on the **last** segment
 * only and each suggestion's value repeats the segments already typed.
 * Discord replaces the whole option value with whatever the member
 * picks; a value carrying just the candidate would silently discard the
 * accounts they had already named.
 *
 * Those earlier segments are re-parsed with `parseFeedAccounts` — the
 * same function the command itself reads the option with — so the
 * echoed prefix is exactly what the deletion will act on. A suggestion
 * that normalised the list differently from the command would quietly
 * change the scope the member thought they had chosen.
 *
 * Pure: it takes documents and strings, so the matching, the exclusion
 * and the length bounds are testable without an interaction or a
 * database.
