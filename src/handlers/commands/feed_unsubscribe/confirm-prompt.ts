 * The prompt `/feed_unsubscribe` shows before clearing a whole channel.

 * The copy is deliberately blunt about being irreversible. The
 * ephemeral confirmation that used to follow the deletion told a member
 * what had already happened; this one is the last point at which they
 * can still say no.
