/**
 * `/feed_unsubscribe` — stop forwarding social posts into a channel.
 *
 * Channel-centric, matching the subscription key: the channel is always
 * part of the scope (defaulting to the invoking one), and `platform` /
 * `account` — which accepts a list — only narrow it. Reach is bounded
 * by `gateFeedChannel`, for the deletion and for the suggestions alike.
 *
 * Naming neither narrowing option is the widest scope a member can ask
 * for, and the one an after-the-fact confirmation cannot undo, so it
 * deletes nothing on its own: it counts what would go and asks. A
 * narrowed scope names what it removes and applies at once. Nothing
 * here consults the upstream — a subscription must stay removable after
 * its platform has been switched off in config.
