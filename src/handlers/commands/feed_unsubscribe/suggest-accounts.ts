/**
 * `/feed_unsubscribe`'s autocomplete hook: which of the channel's
 * subscribed accounts to offer for the `account` option.
 *
 * A database read and nothing else. The upstream platform is never
 * consulted — an autocomplete response is due within three seconds of
 * a keystroke, and the answer is already stored: the option names
 * accounts *this guild subscribed*, not accounts that exist.
 *
 * Scope mirrors what the command would delete if the member sent it
 * now, so the list never suggests something the command would then
 * refuse or miss: the `channel` option once they have filled it in,
 * otherwise the invoking channel, narrowed by `platform` when set.
 *
 * The same visibility gate the command and its confirmation button use
 * applies here too. Suggestions are a read of guild state, and a
 * channel the invoker cannot see must not leak its subscriptions
 * through a dropdown any more than through a reply — with the
 * difference that here the refusal is silent, because an autocomplete
 * interaction has no way to explain itself.
