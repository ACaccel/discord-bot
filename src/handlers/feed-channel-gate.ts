/**
 * The visibility gate `/feed_unsubscribe` and its confirmation button
 * share.
 *
 * Authority over a feed subscription is ungated — any member may
 * subscribe or unsubscribe — so reach is what bounds the damage: a
 * member only operates on a channel they can already `ViewChannel`.
 * That rule is enforced from two places (the command, and the button
 * that confirms clearing a whole channel), and a gate that drifted
 * between them would be a hole rather than a cosmetic inconsistency.
 * Hence one helper, returning the refusal copy with it so both surfaces
 * also say the same thing. `/feed_subscribe` and `/feed_list` still
 * carry their own copies of the check.
 *
 * Nothing here touches the database or the platform registry: the gate
 * answers from the guild cache alone, which is what lets the confirm
 * button re-check it cheaply before it deletes.
