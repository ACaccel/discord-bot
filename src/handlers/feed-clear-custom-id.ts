 * The customId contract between `/feed_unsubscribe`'s confirmation
 * prompt and the two buttons that answer it.
 *
 * The dispatcher selects a handler by the customId's leading segment
 * (see `createCustomIdDispatcher`), so the ids below are also the
 * handler directory names — a rename that touched only one of the two
 * would leave a live button nobody answers. Encoding and decoding live
 * together for the same reason: the command writes the id and the
 * buttons read it back, and a format the two disagreed about would
 * surface as a silently dead button rather than as an error.
 *
 * A button is a public component, so the payload carries no authority:
 * it names the channel to clear and the member who asked, and the
 * confirm handler re-derives every permission from scratch.
