 * time this runs, so a reply that overflowed the 2000-character limit
 * would be rejected, fall into the handler's error boundary, and tell
 * the member the operation *failed* — after it had irreversibly
 * succeeded. Truncating with a count of the remainder keeps the message
 * deliverable and honest; the full list goes to the operator log.
