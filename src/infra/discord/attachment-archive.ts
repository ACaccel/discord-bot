/**
 * Archive a deleted Discord attachment to disk for forensics.
 *
 * Lives in `infra/discord/` because it imports `discord.js`, `axios`,
 * and `fs` — third-party SDK dependencies that the `core/` layer
 * deliberately excludes.
 *
 * This is the fallback path. Discord purges the CDN object for an
 * attachment nearly synchronously with the message deletion, so a
 * download started from `messageDelete` frequently 404s even though the
 * signed URL is still valid. The reliable path is the pre-delete cache
 * in `attachment-cache.ts`; what remains here is a best-effort attempt
 * for messages the cache never saw, hardened with one retry against
 * `media.discordapp.net`, whose cache often still holds recently
 * displayed media.
