/**
 * Pre-delete attachment cache.
 *
 * Discord purges an attachment's CDN object nearly synchronously with
 * the message deletion, so the download `attachment-archive` starts
 * from `messageDelete` usually races and loses: the signed URL is still
 * valid, the object behind it is already gone. The only reliable way to
 * keep the bytes is to hold them before the deletion happens. This
 * module downloads every attachment when its message is created and, at
 * delete time, renames the cached copy into the archive tree instead of
 * touching the network.
 *
 * Layout: `<cacheRoot>/<guildId>/<messageId>/<attachmentId>-<name>`.
 * Keying by message id is what lets a deletion — single or bulk — find
 * its files with one `readdir`.
 *
 * Privacy: while an entry lives, a copy of every recent attachment sits
 * on the bot host, not only the deleted ones. The TTL sweep bounds that
 * window; see the `permission_rank` note in `docs/architecture.md`.
 *
 * Availability: caching writes bytes nobody asked for, so it yields the
 * volume before filling it — new entries stop while free space is under
 * the configured floor. The delete-time paths are never gated by it:
 * declining to archive loses evidence outright, while declining to
 * cache only forfeits a head start on it.
 *
 * Every operation swallows its own failures. Caching is a best-effort
 * side channel and must never disturb the message flow that triggers it.
