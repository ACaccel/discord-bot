 * `/feed_subscribe`'s per-account report) and a page that overflows the
 * message limit is rejected outright — losing the whole page, not its
 * tail — so the rule is worth stating once.
 *
 * No discord.js types: the only thing borrowed from Discord is the
 * limit, which makes this testable as plain string work.
