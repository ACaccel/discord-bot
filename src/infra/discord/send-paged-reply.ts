/**
 * Ephemeral multi-page reply delivery.
 *
 * A listing longer than Discord's 2000-character message limit is sent
 * as one `editReply` plus N `followUp` messages. The naive loop —
 * `for (...) await interaction.followUp(...)` inside the handler's
 * `try` — has a specific failure mode: when page 3 of 5 is rejected,
 * the rejection escapes to the handler's `catch`, `replyForError` calls
 * `editReply`, and the error line **overwrites page 1**. The user is
 * left with an error where the header used to be, pages 4 and 5 never
 * sent, and no indication that anything was delivered at all.
 *
 * So each page is isolated. A page that fails is logged and skipped,
 * the remaining pages still go out, and the partial delivery is
 * reported with one more `followUp` — never an `editReply`, because
 * everything already on screen is real output that must survive.
 *
 * Ordering is sequential on purpose: Discord renders follow-ups in
 * arrival order, and `Promise.all` would interleave a paginated list
 * into nonsense.
