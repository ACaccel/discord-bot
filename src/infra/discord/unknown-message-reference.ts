/**
 * The "the message we are replying to is gone" test for `message.reply`.
 *
 * A reply carries a `message_reference` to its parent, and when the parent
 * was deleted between the event and the reply Discord rejects the whole
 * request as an invalid form body (`50035`) with a
 * `MESSAGE_REFERENCE_UNKNOWN_MESSAGE` field error. That is a race any
 * reply that does real work first will lose sometimes — a preview probe
 * or an LLM call is plenty of time for the author to withdraw the
 * message — and it is nobody's defect, so it must not be filed at the
 * same severity as a rejected payload.
 *
 * `50035` alone is not enough: it is Discord's catch-all for every
 * malformed payload, so the field error is checked as well.
