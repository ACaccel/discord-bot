/**
 * OgClient — SSRF-safe OpenGraph metadata fetcher.
 *
 * The single network boundary for the link-preview layer. Two callers:
 *   - the rewrite providers, which fetch each candidate proxy URL to
 *     VALIDATE (before posting) that Discord will get media — using the
 *     Discord crawler UA so we observe exactly what Discord's unfurl sees;
 *   - the Bahamut provider, which scrapes the source page's OpenGraph.
 * Modeled on `infra/llm/selfhosted-client.ts`: axios + Result + the shared
 * {@link translateLinkPreviewError}. Never throws a `DomainError` — every
 * failure lands on the Result's Err rail so the caller can stay silent.
 *
 * What Discord's unfurl actually accepts — and what we must mirror to
 * validate faithfully — is one of two things at the proxy URL:
 *   1. an HTML page carrying OpenGraph tags (most proxies), or
 *   2. a redirect (for a bot UA) straight to a `video/*` / `image/*` file
 *      that Discord embeds directly (e.g. `kkinstagram` 302s a reel to a
 *      `*.mp4` on the Instagram CDN).
 * So the response is classified by its final `Content-Type`: a media type
 * is itself a valid playable preview (no body is downloaded), otherwise the
 * body is treated as HTML and only its `<head>` is read for `<meta>` tags.
 * The URL the response was finally served from is reported alongside
 * (`finalUrl`): a proxy that cannot fetch a post tends to redirect back to
 * the source site, and what the source then serves THIS host says nothing
 * about what it will serve Discord's crawler — the rewrite providers use
 * `finalUrl` to recognise and skip that case.
 *
 * SSRF mitigations (the initial host always comes from the operator's
 * configured proxy-host allow-list, or the provider's `canHandle` host
 * allow-list — never arbitrary user input; only the path/query is
 * user-derived):
 *   - Follow at most {@link SAFE_MAX_REDIRECTS} redirects (proxies redirect
 *     to a render / CDN host, and Discord's crawler follows them — so we
 *     must too, or validation false-negatives), but the `beforeRedirect`
 *     guard rejects any hop targeting a private / loopback / link-local
 *     address or a non-`http(s)` scheme. So a crafted redirect to an
 *     internal address still cannot be chased.
 *   - Response is streamed and read incrementally: a media `Content-Type`
 *     is classified from headers alone (the multi-MB body is never pulled),
 *     and an HTML body is read only up to the `<head>` close or a byte cap,
 *     so a hostile or huge page cannot exhaust memory.
 *   - `timeout` bounds time-to-headers; an explicit read deadline bounds the
 *     body read, so a slow trickle cannot stall the event handler.
 *
 * Name resolution is bounded separately, because the request timeout
 * cannot reach it: Node's default `dns.lookup` runs `getaddrinfo` on the
 * libuv threadpool, where a query to a host whose name servers have gone
 * silent (a dead embed proxy, typically) holds a thread for tens of seconds
 * after axios has already given up. A few such probes fill the pool and
 * every other lookup in the process — the Discord API, the database, the
 * LLM providers — queues behind them. So every probe resolves through a
 * c-ares resolver with its own per-query timeout, off the threadpool (see
 * {@link createBoundedLookup}); a dead proxy costs one short DNS timeout
 * and nothing else.
 * Only the `<head>` is scanned for `<meta>` tags via a bounded regex, so
 * no heavy HTML parser dependency is introduced.
