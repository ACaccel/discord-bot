/**
 * Template for proxy-rewrite providers (Strategy + Template Method).
 *
 * Every video-capable source (Twitter/X, Instagram, Threads, Facebook)
 * shares one shape: a post URL is rewritten onto a third-party embed-proxy
 * domain so DISCORD unfurls it into a playable video / rich embed. Because
 * proxy domains die and vary in per-content support, the provider VALIDATES
 * before returning: it probes a priority-ordered list of proxy hosts,
 * fetching each candidate's OpenGraph (via {@link OgClient}, with the Discord
 * crawler UA so it sees exactly what Discord will), and picks the best:
 *
 *   - first host whose OG has a video  -> return immediately (playable);
 *   - else the first host with a post image (remembered, keep looking for video);
 *   - else the first host whose only images are low-value stand-ins — some
 *     proxies fall back to the author's avatar when they cannot resolve the
 *     post's own media, which is technically an image but carries none of the
 *     post's content, so it must lose to a proxy holding the real asset while
 *     still beating a bare title;
 *   - else the first host with a title  (text-only, weakest fallback);
 *   - else nothing usable -> `ok(null)` so the orchestrator skips silently
 *     and NO bare/dead link is ever posted.
 *
 * A candidate is ranked only if the proxy actually served it. When the probe
 * is finally served from the source site itself (`sourceDomains`) the proxy
 * has punted: it could not fetch the post and redirected to instagram.com /
 * x.com / ... instead. The OpenGraph read there is what the source serves to
 * THIS host's address, not what Discord's crawler will get from its own —
 * typically a login wall with a title and no content — so such a host is
 * skipped outright, however good its metadata looks.
 *
 * Per-host probe failures are logged at debug (proxy flakiness is expected),
 * never surfaced as `Err`, and never end the walk: every host is probed
 * until one yields a video or the list runs out, so a dead host early in
 * the list costs its `ctx.timeoutMs` and nothing more. That per-host
 * timeout is the only bound, which makes worst-case latency the list
 * length times the timeout — the operator keeps the lists short.
 *
 * The per-source files supply `matches` (pure predicate), the `proxyHosts`
 * list, and `toProxyUrl`. This file performs network I/O but returns only a
 * URL string — it must NOT import discord.js.

 * to get data from Reddit". Threads and its embed proxies serve a login
 * wall — in English or zh-TW depending on the page — that still carries a
 * generic Instagram logo as `og:image`, so without a marker it would score
 * as a usable image card. An Instagram proxy that cannot resolve a post
 * answers with its product name as the title and "Post not found" as the
 * description. Scoring any of these as a usable card would post a broken
