/**
 * Threads provider. Rewrites a post URL onto one of the operator-configured
 * embed-proxy domains so Discord renders an embed. Matches both the legacy
 * `threads.net` and current `threads.com` hosts.
 *
 * On top of the generic rewrite template this provider expands the
 * `/share/<token>` short links the Threads app's share button emits. The
 * token is opaque — it carries no post id — so every embed proxy serves a
 * login wall for it; only the canonical `/@user/post/<id>` permalink is
 * previewable. The expansion is a redirect chase, but two Threads quirks
 * make it unlike Facebook's: the redirect is served only to a minimal
 * User-Agent (see {@link SHARE_RESOLVE_USER_AGENT}), and the permalink is
 * an intermediate hop rather than the chain's destination (see
 * {@link resolveShareLink}). Hence the hop-scanning resolution instead of
 * `OgClient.resolveCanonical`.
 *
 * No single Threads proxy is good at every post type, so the three healthy
 * ones divide the work and the probe loop's ordering plus its quality tiers
 * pick the right one per post. `viewthreads.com` serves the real post title
 * and the real post image but never `og:video`, which makes it the best card
 * for an ordinary still-image post and only a static thumbnail for a video.
 * `fzthreads.com` and `fixthreads.seria.moe` serve a fetchable `og:video`,
 * and `fzthreads.com` also resolves login-restricted posts the other two
 * cannot. Their weakness is the mirror image: for a post with no media of
 * its own they answer with the author's profile avatar as `og:image`, which
 * the weak-image tier demotes below any proxy holding a real post asset
 * while still ranking it above a text-only embed (see
 * {@link LOW_VALUE_IMAGE_PATTERNS}). Listing the real-asset proxy ahead of
 * the video proxies therefore costs nothing — a video candidate
 * short-circuits the loop from any position — and wins the ordinary post a
 * card built from real post media.
 *
 * `vxthreads.net` is unreachable, `fixthreads.net` and the `threadsez.*`
 * hosts no longer resolve, and a login wall carries a generic Instagram logo
 * as `og:image` and so is rejected by the shared junk-marker filter rather
 * than posted as a broken card. Per-host validation is what keeps all of
 * this honest as proxies come and go: each host is tried until one yields
 * media, a recovered proxy starts contributing again on its own, and while
 * every proxy is degraded Threads previews are skipped silently with no bare
 * link posted.
