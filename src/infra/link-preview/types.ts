/**
 * Link-preview provider types and Strategy interface.
 *
 * The link-preview Strategy lives in the infra layer (`src/infra/link-preview/`,
 * alongside `infra/llm/` and `infra/discord/`) because it is an outbound
 * boundary: providers either rewrite a URL to a third-party embed-proxy
 * domain or fetch a page's OpenGraph metadata. Discord-specific assembly
 * (building the embed, replying, suppressing the original) is the
 * consuming plugin's job — providers return neutral data only, so this
 * layer stays free of discord.js message I/O.
 *
 * Two preview mechanisms, one uniform result (discriminated union):
 *   - `rewritten-url`: reply with a proxy-domain URL and let DISCORD
 *     unfurl it into a playable video embed. A bot-authored embed cannot
 *     render playable video, so this is the only path that yields one.
 *     Rewrite providers VALIDATE before returning: they probe a priority
 *     list of proxy hosts (fetching each candidate's OpenGraph with the
 *     Discord crawler UA) and return the first that yields media — so a
 *     dead/empty proxy is never posted as a bare link.
 *   - `card`: neutral OpenGraph data the plugin renders into a static
 *     `EmbedBuilder` (used for sources without a public proxy, e.g.
 *     Bahamut).
 *
 * Adding a new provider:
 *   1. Implement {@link LinkPreviewProvider} (or reuse `createRewriteProvider`
 *      for a proxy-rewrite source — it needs an `OgClient` for validation)
 *      in `src/infra/link-preview/providers/`.
 *   2. Append the name to {@link LinkPreviewProviderName} below.
 *   3. Add one line to `createDefaultLinkPreviewRegistry`
 *      (`src/infra/link-preview/default-registry.ts`) plus its required
 *      proxy-host field on `LinkPreviewRegistryDeps`, the matching
 *      `<source>ProxyHosts` key on the plugin's config schema, and a
 *      recommended list in each bot's `config.example.json` — proxy hosts
 *      are operator configuration, so a rewrite source is not usable until
 *      an operator can supply them.
 * The plugin's orchestrator does not branch on provider names internally.
 *
 * Error contract: a fetching provider's `build()` MUST translate
 * transport / HTTP / parse failures into a {@link LinkPreviewError} on
 * the Result's Err rail before returning. It never throws a
 * `DomainError`: a preview failure is logged and swallowed so the user's
 * message is never broken by an unavailable upstream.
