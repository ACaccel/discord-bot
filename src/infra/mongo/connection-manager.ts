/**
 * Per-guild MongoDB connection lifecycle.
 *
 * Owns the SDK boundary to mongoose: opening, closing, and tracking
 * one `Connection` per guild id. Repositories receive a `Connection`
 * (via {@link ConnectionManager.getConnection}) and never touch
 * `mongoose.createConnection` themselves — that keeps `persistence/`
 * free of SDK lifecycle concerns and makes test substitution trivial.
 *
 * Why `infra/mongo/` and not `persistence/`:
 *   `persistence/` owns the mapping from domain to storage (schemas +
 *   repositories). Connection acquisition is the SDK boundary, the same
 *   category as a Discord client or LLM HTTP client, per the layer
 *   rules that keep SDK boundaries out of `persistence/`.
 *
 * Resilience:
 *   `getConnection` classifies a failed open via the `persistence/`
 *   error-translator. A *transient* failure (`DATABASE_TIMEOUT` /
 *   `DATABASE_NETWORK`) is retried with bounded exponential backoff; a
 *   *persistent* failure — or a transient one whose retries are
 *   exhausted — marks the guild **disabled**. Once disabled, every
 *   subsequent `getConnection(guildId)` short-circuits with the same
 *   `DatabaseError` (no further cluster traffic) until {@link close} /
 *   {@link closeAll} clears the marker. Each disabled marker carries a
 *   generated `traceId` so the user-facing `errors:db.guild_disabled`
 *   message can be grep-correlated to the structured boot log.
 *
 *   Per-URI sharing: `MongoConnectionManager` instances are pooled by
 *   base URI in the composition root (`BaseBot.sharedConnectionManagers`).
 *   Because the disabled set is now manager-internal state, two bots
 *   that share one base URI also share one disabled set — a guild
 *   disabled for one is disabled for the other. This is intentional:
 *   they target the same physical database, so the failure is the
 *   same failure.
