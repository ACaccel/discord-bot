/**
 * `infra/social-feed` barrel.
 *
 * The social-feed platform Strategy lives in the infra layer because of
 * its outbound edge: a platform reads an account's posts over HTTP and
 * `error-translator` maps the failures into the shared domain taxonomy.
 * The platform-neutral rules built on that edge — the registry, the
 * config schema, the baseline cursor — sit here too, since they name
 * `FeedPlatform` (which bars `core`) and are shared by the plugin and
 * the `feed_*` commands, which are sibling layers that may not import
 * each other.
 *
 * Discord-specific assembly (resolving a channel, rendering, posting)
 * belongs to the consuming `src/plugins/social-feed/` plugin, and
 * subscription bookkeeping to the commands.
