 * list that parsed differently between subscribing and unsubscribing
 * would leave entries no command could remove. It lives beside
 * `normalizeAccount` because what it produces is a list of feed account
 * handles; the `@` strip and the case-insensitive de-duplication are
 * account rules, not option-reading ones.
 *
 * Pure string work, deliberately platform-agnostic. Canonicalising an
 * entry stays with `FeedPlatform.normalizeAccount`, which each command
 * runs afterwards on every entry it got back.

 * 8-second platform timeout and roughly 95 at the configurable
 * 30-second ceiling — twenty of the latter would overrun the window, so
 * the cap alone is not the guarantee. `/feed_subscribe` stops the batch
