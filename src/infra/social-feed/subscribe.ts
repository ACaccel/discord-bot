 *
 * It lives in infra rather than in the handler for two reasons. It is
 * the platform-facing half of subscribing, so it belongs next to
 * {@link FeedPlatform} and the baseline rule it composes; and keeping
 * it out of `index.ts` leaves the handler holding only Discord work,
 * which is the layer split the 150-line handler cap exists to enforce.
 *
 * The upstream read is skipped for an existing subscription on purpose.
 * Re-running the command is how a filter is changed, the stored cursor
 * is preserved either way, and an upstream outage must not stand
 * between a member and turning a keyword off.
