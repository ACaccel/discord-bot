/**

 * Lives in the infra layer alongside `infra/llm/` and
 * `infra/link-preview/` because it is an outbound boundary: an
 * implementation reads an account's recent posts over HTTP. Everything
 * returned here is neutral data — no discord.js types, no rendering —
 * so the consuming `src/plugins/social-feed/` plugin owns all Discord
 * assembly and a platform stays unit-testable without a client.
 *
 * Why a Strategy: the operations that differ between X, Bluesky, or any
 * later source are not just "fetch" but also how an account name is
 * spelled, how two post ids order, and what URL Discord can unfurl.
 * Pinning the plugin and the subscription commands to
 * {@link FeedPlatform} keeps a new source to one new file in
 * `./platforms/` plus one composition-root line, and keeps
 * platform-specific arithmetic (X's snowflake ids) out of the plugin.
 *
 * Error contract: `fetchTimeline` and `normalizeAccount` MUST translate
 * every failure onto the Result's Err rail. They never throw a
 * `DomainError` — a feed read is background work whose failure is
 * logged and retried on the next pass, never surfaced to a channel.
