/**
 * `FxTwitterTimelineSource` — reads an account's recent posts from an
 * FxTwitter-compatible JSON API (`GET {base}/2/profile/{handle}/statuses`).
 *
 * Chosen over X's official API because that API has no free tier and
 * bills per post read, which a five-minute poller cannot justify. The
 * trade-off is a community-run upstream that may change or disappear —
 * absorbed three ways: this class is one {@link XTimelineSource}
 * implementation behind a Strategy, `apiBaseUrl` can point at a
 * self-hosted instance, and the consuming plugin defaults to disabled.
 *
 * Upstream behaviours this client is built around (all verified against
 * the live API, and none of them documented):
 *
 *   - **`count` is ignored.** The endpoint always returns a full page
 *     (~20 entries), so the caller caps how many it acts on. No `count`
 *     is sent rather than sending a parameter that does nothing.
 *   - **`since` gates the status code, it does not filter.** With
 *     `since` set, a timeline holding nothing newer answers `204`;
 *     otherwise it answers `200` with the **whole** page, including
 *     posts far older than `since`. It is therefore a bandwidth
 *     optimisation only — de-duplication is the caller's job.
 *   - **`since` is a strict `>`.** `since = <newest post's timestamp>`
 *     answers `204`. A post created in the same second as the newest one
 *     already seen would stay invisible while that cursor holds, which
 *     is why the caller periodically re-reads with no `since` at all.
 *   - **Entries are not ordered by `created_timestamp`.** A repost
 *     carries the *original* post's timestamp while sitting at its
 *     repost position, so the sequence is only monotonic once reposts
 *     are dropped. Callers sort defensively.
 *   - **`404` is a valid JSON body**, not just a status — an unknown or
 *     renamed handle. The `validateStatus` below turns it into a thrown
 *     error so it reaches the taxonomy translator like any other failure.
