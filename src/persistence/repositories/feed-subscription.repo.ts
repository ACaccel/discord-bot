 * `FeedSubscriptionRepo` — social-feed subscriptions, one document per

 * source of truth for what is subscribed: the slash commands write
 * here, and each poll pass reads the current list, so a subscription
 * takes effect on the next pass without any cross-module notification.
 *
 * The document also carries the polling cursor. The poller advances it
 * only after the matching posts have actually been delivered, so a
 * failed send is retried on the next pass rather than skipped.
 *
 * Error boundary: every method returns `Result<T, DatabaseError>`. A
 * mongoose failure is translated by the shared `databaseErrorFrom`
 * translator and returned as `err`; a missing lookup is a success
 * (`ok(undefined)` / `ok([])`) — an unsubscribed channel is not an
 * error.
