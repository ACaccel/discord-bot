/**
 * Social-feed subscription: one document per `(platform, account,
 * channel_id)` triple, carrying the subscription itself, its per-
 * subscription filter, and its polling cursor.
 *
 * The guild is implicit — each guild owns its own database — so the
 * triple alone is the key, and the compound unique index enforces it.
 * The same account may be subscribed from several channels; each such
 * subscription keeps its own cursor, which is what makes an unsubscribe
 * scoped to one channel a well-defined operation.
 *
 * Holding the cursor in the subscription document means a removed
 * subscription takes its cursor with it: there is no orphaned cursor
 * state to reconcile at boot, and re-subscribing starts from the
 * present rather than replaying a backlog.
 *
 * `last_seen_id` is a String because post ids on X are 64-bit and
 * exceed `Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER`; storing them as a Number would
 * collapse distinct ids. Ordering comparisons are delegated to the
 * platform adapter, which knows the id's shape.
 *
 * Two document types come out of this file. {@link StoredFeedSubscription}
 * is what a `lean` read really hands back; {@link FeedSubscriptionDoc}
 * is the tightened contract the repository produces from it. Keeping
 * them apart is what stops the tightening from being an unchecked
 * assertion — see the repository's `normalize`.
