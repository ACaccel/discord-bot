/**
 * Configuration schema and defaults for the auto-reply plugin.
 *
 * The per-user "lucky reply" behaviour is pure operator data: which
 * Discord user it targets, how often it fires, and what it says are all
 * facts about one server's in-jokes, not about the bot. Keeping them in
 * `config.json` means adding or retiring one is a config edit, and the
 * lines stay out of the translation catalog — they are a specific
 * person's running gag, not bot copy with a locale.
 *
 * `.strict()` surfaces a mistyped key at startup rather than silently
 * ignoring it. Every field defaults, so a bot may omit the `auto_reply`
 * block entirely and still boot with lucky replies switched off.
