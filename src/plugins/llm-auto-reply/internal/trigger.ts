/**
 * Bot-mention trigger handling for the LLM auto-reply plugin.
 *
 * A message that @-mentions the bot fires a reply deterministically,
 * bypassing the random probability gate (and the cooldown / in-flight /
 * window guards) — the same role the old `fatcat_reply` keyword played, now
 * mirroring konata's llm-chat trigger. The downstream `messageCount`
 * requirement still applies — a mention only skips the dice roll, not the
 * context check. The probabilistic automatic reply is unaffected.
 *
 * The mention token is a control marker, not conversation, so it is stripped
 * from a message's transcript content before the prompt is built.
