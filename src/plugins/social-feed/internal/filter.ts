/**
 * Pure selection logic over a fetched timeline page: which entries a
 * subscription actually wants, which of those are new, and in what
 * order they go out.
 *
 * Two tiers of rule, deliberately separated:
 *
 *   - **Hard rules**, which no subscription may relax — the post must
 *     be the followed account's own (not a repost of someone else's)
 *     and must not be a reply. Forwarding either would put text a third
 *     party wrote, or a fragment of a conversation, into a channel that
 *     asked for one account's posts.
 *   - **Subscription filter**, the operator-chosen media and keyword
 *     narrowing, whose defaults reproduce the historical behaviour of
 *     forwarding only media-carrying posts.
 *
 * Everything here reads {@link FeedPost} fields only; ordering and
 * cursor comparison are delegated to the platform, so no
 * platform-specific arithmetic (X's snowflake ids) leaks into the
 * plugin. Kept free of I/O so every rule is unit-testable without a
 * network, a database, or a Discord client.
