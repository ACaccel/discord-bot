/**
 * One pass of the social-feed poller: read every guild's stored
 * subscriptions, fetch each followed account's recent posts once, and
 * forward what each subscription's own filter accepts.
 *
 * The database is the source of truth for what is followed, so a
 * subscription written by a `/feed_*` command takes effect on the next
 * pass with no cross-module notification.
 *
 * Failure isolation is layered so a background loop can never be taken
 * down by one bad guild, subscription, or send: a guild whose
 * subscription read fails is skipped, an upstream read that fails skips
 * only the subscriptions on that account, each subscription is wrapped
 * individually, and the plugin wrapping this reschedules itself in a
 * `finally`.
 *
 * Cursor discipline — the invariant the whole design rests on:
 *   - the stored cursor is always a post that was *actually delivered*
 *     (or, when a subscription is first seeded, the baseline that
 *     suppresses backfill);
 *   - it advances only after a successful send, so a failed send is
 *     retried on the next pass instead of being skipped;
 *   - it is compared by post id through the platform, never by
 *     timestamp, because an upstream's `since` parameter only gates a
 *     `204` and does not filter the page it returns.
