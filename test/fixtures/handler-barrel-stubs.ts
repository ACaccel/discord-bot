/**
 * Stubs for the five handler barrels (`@cmd`, `@button`, `@modal`,
 * `@select-menu`, `@reaction`).
 *
 * Every test that boots a real `BaseBot` has to neutralise them: the
 * barrels pull in `registry.generated.ts`, which imports every handler
 * in the tree, which drags the whole handler layer — and its Discord
 * and Mongo dependencies — into a test about bot lifecycle.
 *
 * `vi.mock` is hoisted above imports by vitest's transform, so the
 * calls have to live in the test file itself. What is shared here are
 * the factories, which is where the actual duplication was: a test
 * file declares the five one-line mocks and points each at the
 * matching factory below.
 *
 * Usage:
 *
 * ```ts
 * import { barrelStubs } from '../../fixtures/handler-barrel-stubs';
 *
 * vi.mock('@cmd', () => barrelStubs.cmd);
 * vi.mock('@button', () => barrelStubs.button);
 * vi.mock('@modal', () => barrelStubs.modal);
 * vi.mock('@select-menu', () => barrelStubs.selectMenu);
 * vi.mock('@reaction', () => barrelStubs.reaction);
 * ```
