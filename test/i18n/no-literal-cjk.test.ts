/**
 * CJK-literal scanner — enforces that every user-facing string in the
 * handler / plugin / bot layers flows through the translator
 * (`Translator.t`) rather than living as an inline literal. The scanner
 * is strict: any CJK literal in a scoped directory fails the suite.
 *
 * Whitelist mechanism: prefix the offending line with
 * `// i18n-ignore: <reason>` to silence the scanner. The reason is
 * required so future readers see WHY a literal stayed inline
 * (e.g. a command-builder default that Discord ignores anyway, or a
 * raw fragment that happens to contain CJK).
 *
 * Scope rationale:
 *   - `src/handlers/**` (commands / buttons / modals / SSMs / reactions)
 *     and `src/plugins/**` reach Discord users directly.
 *   - `src/infra/**` reaches users indirectly: an adapter that formats
 *     a string for a Discord reply (the LLM usage footer) must take the
 *     already-translated text from its caller rather than inline it.
 *   - `src/bot/**` (composition roots + bot subclasses) is scanned too:
 *     personalities route their help / presence text through translator
 *     keys (e.g. Nijika's `helpMessageKey`, Konata's
 *     `replies:konata.presence_text`). `src/bot/index.ts` BaseBot only
 *     emits ops-log lines that are deliberately English; if a future
 *     change reintroduces CJK there, the scanner catches it.
