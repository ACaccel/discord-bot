/**
 * Routing contract of the dispatch middleware.
 *
 * The middleware is a switch over the interaction discriminant, and the
 * autocomplete arm is the one that must not be reached by any other:
 * `executeCommand` replies on a handler miss, and an autocomplete
 * interaction has no reply channel — that call would reject, escape to
 * the bridge, and be retried there against the same dead interaction.
 *
 * The dispatchers themselves are stubbed; what is asserted here is
 * which one was picked and that `next()` still ran, so the
 * observability stages behind dispatch keep firing.
