/**
 * The button that actually clears a channel's feed subscriptions.
 *
 * This is where `/feed_unsubscribe`'s widest scope commits, so the
 * suite asserts on what reaches the repository, not only on the reply:
 * every refusal branch must leave `deleteWhere` untouched. The customId
 * is a public value and the gap between prompt and click is long enough
 * for a permission to be revoked in, so the handler re-derives the
 * guild, the repositories, and the invoker's visibility from scratch —
 * and each of those re-checks is tested here.
