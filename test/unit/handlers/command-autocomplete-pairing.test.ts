/**
 * Sweep over every registered command, pinning the two halves of the
 * autocomplete contract against each other.
 *
 * The contract is three-part — an option flagged `autocomplete: true`,
 * a `Command.autocomplete` hook, and the dispatcher that joins them —
 * and the pairing is the part no type can express: `setConfig` runs in
 * a constructor, so the compiler never sees the flag next to the hook.
 * Its failure mode is also the quietest one in the framework. A flag
 * with no hook deploys cleanly and offers an empty dropdown forever; a
 * hook with no flag is code Discord never calls. Neither raises
 * anything at runtime, so this sweep is the only thing that can catch
 * them.
 *
 * The JSON build is swept here for the same reason: `buildCommandJsonBody`
 * rejects a misdeclared option, but only a command whose own test
 * happens to call it would ever reach that check. Running it over every
 * command is what makes that rejection a test-time failure rather than
 * a `yarn deploy` one.
