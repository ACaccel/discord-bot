/**
 * The visibility gate `/feed_unsubscribe` shares with its confirmation
 * button.
 *
 * This helper is the only thing standing between ungated authority and
 * a member emptying the feeds of a channel that is closed to them, and
 * it is consulted from two places — the command and the button that
 * confirms a whole-channel clear. Testing it directly is what keeps the
 * two honest: a regression here would otherwise only surface as a
 * missing assertion in one of the two handler suites.
 *
 * The refusal keys are asserted, not just the fact of a refusal:
 * "unknown" and "you cannot see it" are different answers, and a gate
 * that collapsed them would tell a member their permissions were
 * revoked when the cache was merely cold.
