/**
 * Guards the shipped example configs against the plugin's own schema.
 *
 * The plugin parses its block at construction time regardless of
 * `enabled`, so an example that does not satisfy the schema is not a
 * documentation nit — an operator who seeds `config.json` from
 * `config.example.json` (which is exactly what CI does, and what the
 * setup instructions tell a human to do) would crash the bot at boot.
 *
 * Every personality that registers the social-feed plugin ships such an
 * example, so the checks run over each of them: an example that drifts
 * from the schema breaks the same way whichever bot owns it.
