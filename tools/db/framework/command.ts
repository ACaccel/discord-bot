/**
 * The extensibility contract for the `db` ops CLI.
 *
 * Each maintenance operation is a Strategy ({@link DbCommandSpec}) that
 * declares its subcommand `name`, help `description`, a zod schema for
 * its own options slice, and a `run` that receives injected collaborators
 * and returns a {@link DbCommandResult}. `run` is pure of process
 * concerns — it never calls `process.exit`; the entry point maps the
 * returned `exitCode`.
 *
 * {@link defineCommand} wraps a typed spec into an erased
 * {@link RegisteredCommand}: the generic option type is captured inside
 * the `execute` closure (which validates the raw options via the spec's
 * schema before calling `run`), so the registry can hold commands of
 * differing option shapes in one array without `any` and without an
 * unchecked cast. Adding a future operation is: write a spec module,
 * register it, and add its `operations` section to `config.example.json`.
