/**
 * Root Vitest config — coverage / shared settings only. The project
 * layout (unit / integration / contract / i18n / tools) lives in
 * `vitest.workspace.ts`. Yarn scripts pick a project via `--project`.
 *
 * Coverage thresholds:
 *   - `src/core/**` carries a high floor (90% line / func / statement,
 *     89% branch); core is pure infrastructure and is kept
 *     well-covered.
 *   - The overall floors sit a couple of points under the measured
 *     value, so ordinary churn does not trip them but a real
 *     regression does. Every handler entry point is in the
 *     denominator (see `exclude` below); the still-untested query
 *     commands are what holds the line / statement floor below the
 *     branch and function ones.
 *
 * Raise the floors when a batch of tests lifts the measurement — the
 * point of a ratchet is that it only moves one way.
